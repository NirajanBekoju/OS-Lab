\section{Introduction}
Process scheduling, communication, and synchronization are essential concepts in operating systems that deal with managing multiple processes and ensuring that they run efficiently and effectively.

Process scheduling is the process of allocating CPU time to the various processes in a computer system. In modern operating systems, multiple processes may run simultaneously, and the operating system must schedule and manage their execution to ensure that the system runs efficiently. The scheduler determines which process should run next based on various factors, such as priority, the amount of time a process has already used, and the available resources.

Communication between processes is necessary for a variety of reasons, including inter-process communication (IPC), where different processes need to exchange data or signals to achieve some common goal. Processes can communicate with each other through shared memory, message passing, or pipe mechanisms, depending on the operating system and the specific needs of the processes.

Synchronization is the process of coordinating the execution of multiple processes to ensure that they do not interfere with each other or create conflicts while accessing shared resources. Synchronization is essential to avoid race conditions, deadlock, and other issues that can arise when multiple processes attempt to access shared resources simultaneously. Techniques like semaphores, mutex, and conditional variables are used to achieve synchronization among processes.

In summary, process scheduling, communication, and synchronization are all critical components of operating system design, as they ensure that the various processes in a system can work together efficiently, without conflicts or interference, while utilizing the available resources optimally.

\section{Round Robin}
\textbf{Aim : } To write a C program to simulate the CPU scheduling algorithm for round robin.

\textbf{Problem Description : }
CPU scheduler will decide which process should be given the CPU for its execution .For
this it use different algorithm to choose among the process .one among that algorithm is Round
robin algorithm.
In this algorithm we are assigning some time slice .The process is allocated according to
the time slice ,if the process service time is less than the time slice then process itself will release
the CPU voluntarily .The scheduler will then proceed to the next process in the ready queue .If
the CPU burst of the currently running process is longer than time quantum ,the timer will go off
and will cause an interrupt to the operating system .A context switch will be executed and the
process will be put at the tail of the ready queue.

\textbf{Algorithm : }
\begin{verbatim}
  Step 1: Initialize all the structure elements
  Step 2: Receive inputs from the user to fill process id,burst time and arrival time. 
  Step 3: Calculate the waiting time for all the process id.
      i) The waiting time for first instance of a process is calculated as:

          a[i].waittime=count + a[i].arrivt
      
      ii) The waiting time for the rest of the instances of the process is 
          calculated as:
          
          a) If the time quantum is greater than the remaining burst time
          then waiting time is calculated as:a[i].waittime=count + tq
          
          b) Else if the time quantum is greater than the remaining burst time 
          then waiting time is calculated as:
            
              a[i].waittime=count - remaining burst time
  
  Step 4: Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time
  Step 5: Print the results of the step 4.

                the critical section.
                If the mutex value is 0, allow the producer to add value in the temporary
                variable to the buffer.

        \begin{list}{}{}
          \item i. It should wait if the buffer is empty
          \item ii. If there is any item in the buffer check for mutex value, if the mutex==0, remove item from buffer.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this lab report presented the implementation of several important concepts in operating systems, including process scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, round robin, and priority scheduling, and the synchronization mechanism of semaphores in the Producer-Consumer problem. These implementations were done using the C programming language, which allowed for a detailed understanding of the underlying concepts and algorithms. Through the process of implementing and testing these algorithms and synchronization mechanisms, we gained a deeper understanding of the challenges involved in managing and coordinating multiple processes in an operating system. Overall, this lab report provides a valuable contribution to the study of operating systems, and serves as a useful resource for those interested in learning more about these essential concepts in computer science.
